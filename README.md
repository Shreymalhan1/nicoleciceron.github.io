 > Hosting your resume in a static website is a very simple and portable process. It is always a good idea to host a website because documentations always will always get outdated. It gives you the power to fix any inaccuracies and keep all your content up to date instantly while also making sure that your content has also good quality. GitHub has now made it very easy for users to host static websites through GitHub pages. Using MarkDown, a popular markup language, for formatting your web content along with a site generator such as Jekyll results in a really easy and straighforward process in hosting a static website on GitHub Pages. 

## Prerequisites
For this tutorial, you will need two things: 
1) **a Github account.** If you do not have a GitHub account, you would need to make one by going to this link [https://github.com](https://github.com). This tutorial will use the web version of GitHub. 
    > GitHub is very popular Distributed Version Control Systems(DVCS). It has a user-friendly interface  that allows for isolated work and has overall good performance in software development. 
    
2) **a resume formatted in Markdown**. Your resume will need to be formatted in Markdown. Here is a good resource to learn Markdown: []()
    > You would also need a MarkDown Editor for this step. There are a lot of available editors that you can use depending on the opearting system you are using. One good editor is [dillinger.io](https://dillinger.io). 

## Steps

1. First, create a new repository from your GitHub profile. 
    > A repository is a directory where where your files related to your project will be stored. reposritories can either be stored locally or in this case, it would be stored online in GitHub.

2. Inside your repository, add the files **README.md** and **index.md**. The README file will just contain descriptions on what your page is about. For this tutuorial, this file will just conatin a description telling that your site is a sttic website displaying your resume. You can include the process on how you did the process of hosting your site, just like this tutorial. Next, The index file will contain the content you want to be displayed on your static website.

    4.1 Go to your repository's page. On the main tabs, click on **Settings**
    
    4.2 You will be directed to the **Options** tab inside Settings. Scroll down to **GitHub Pages**
